# Test of Replit's capabilities and its AI Agent to quickly setup an interactive web app.

Some of the prompts used:

"I would like to build a webservice that can be used by customers to borrow books."

App plan generated by the Agent:

Build the initial prototype
PostgreSQL database integration
Email notifications for due dates
Book reservation system
Reading recommendations based on borrowing history

After approval, the app was generated and some problems where fixed immediately.

Some minor issues where fixed:

“The cover image of the book "1984" does not load”

“In the administrative interface, editing a book will show an empty editor. It should be filled with the current book details and allow me to make changes to all properties of a book.”

“When I log out, I had to manually refresh the page because it was not showing that I was logged out. Can you do a refresh of the page after logging out?”

“Editing books: I noticed that the new book URL that I added to the book "To Kill a Mockingbird" did not get saved...”


Finally, some visual aspects where improved, and a better name for the service was established:

“Can you add a 50% transparency to the background of the "Available"/"Unavailable" notifier?”

“Can you suggest a bit more inspiring name for the app? And add a nice color theme for that?”

“Also update the description in the footer. This app will be used to accommodate small communal libraries, like small popup-bookcases alongside the road or at private driveways”

“The amber color is a bit too much. Can you soften that a little and remove the background of the search input?”
